%This script performs the optimization of the file CST_optimization.m 20
%times, with an increasing number of CST-coefficients in the design-vector
%x (parameter M increases). This allows to compare the effect of increasing CST-order on the best
%achievable airfoil curve fit (lowest possible error).

%BE AWARE - Running this script takes considerable time (5 ~ 10 minutes)
